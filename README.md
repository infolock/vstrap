# vstrap
NOTE: This is a work in progress!

An ever going quest of mine is to eliminate the need of 3rd party dependencies in order to create JS projects without the need of additional frameworks.   For example, I love bootstrap, but the requirement of having to bring in jQuery was a problem for me.  So, I wanted to know if I could rewrite Bootstrap, but without jQuery.   The result will (hopefully) be in the outcome of this repo project.
